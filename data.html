                            The data depicted in these graphs is the distribution of universities across 
                            different regions in Luzon. Notably, the National Capital Region has the highest 
                            number of universities for three consecutive school years with a total of 313 
                            universities in S.Y. 2016-2017, 315 universities in S.Y. 2017-2018, and 308 
                            universities in S.Y. 2018-2019. On the other hand, the Cordillera Administrative 
                            Region emerges as the region with the lowest number of universities for also three 
                            successive school years, with only 42 universities in S.Y. 2016-2017, 40 universities

                        The graphical representation of university distribution 
                        in Luzon is notable with the <span class="bold">majority being private</span>. 
                        Out of the total number of universities surveyed, 
                        <span class="underline">95% of them belong to the private sector</span>. On the 
                        other hand, <span class="underline">the public sector, represented by SUCs, 
                        accounts for a mere 5%</span> of the total, consisting of 
                        only 57 universities for three consecutive years.

                    <p>
                        We can infer that the possible cause of the dominance 
                        of private colleges in Luzon is the <span class="bold">difference in
                        the source of funding</span>. Private 
                        schools, as privately owned institutions, operate 
                        independently of government funding. In contrast, 
                        public schools rely on budget allocations provided 
                        by the government, leading to limited resources.

                        <p>
                            We can interpret from the histogram that 
                            in the S.Y. 2016-2017, the majority of all 
                            the universities in Luzon have a student population 
                            within the range 1-2001. While the two next school 
                            years have schools with student bodies within range 
                            1-1740 and 2-1764, respectively. While most student 
                            populations lie within the mentioned ranges in specific 
                            school years, there are still some <span class="bold">considerable outliers
                            in the data</span>. For example, the sole college who had a student 
                            population within the range of 64033 to 66033 in S.Y. 
                            2016-2017 is an extreme outlier.

                        2017 to 2018. 50 percent of all the colleges in Luzon had a ratio between 
                        0.048 to 0.143 during this academic year. As of the S.Y. 2018-2019, all 
                        colleges in Luzon had a minimum ratio of 0.001 and, if outliers are taken 
                        into account, a maximum ratio of 1. During this academic year, a ratio of 
                        0.045 to 0.167 are observed at 50% of all the colleges in Luzon.

                        Considering that <span class="bold">the ideal faculty-student ratio is 1:25

                        faculty-student ratio of a college is to 0.04, the more 
                        unsatisfactory it is, as it means that there is a faculty-student 
                        ratio of more than 1:25.</span> This means that 1 faculty staff may have 
                        handled at least 26 students at a time, which is not ideal.

                        To further analyze our data set, the <span class="bold">median</span> shall be used to 
                        encapsulate the whole population of Luzon state and private colleges, 
                        and through determining whether the median of the ratios increase or 
                        decrease in relation to 0.04—which is the standard—we can conclude 
                        whether the faculty-student ratio of the state and private colleges 
                        of Luzon gets better or worse every year. In the three school years,
                        the medians are 0.067, 0.077, and 0.071, respectively. Within these 
                        three school years, it can be concluded that more than half of the 
                        colleges in Luzon had a satisfactory faculty-student ratio as the medians

                        Furthermore, to see a thorough and clear display whether there 
                        really is an association between the changes of the number of 
                        students and faculty to the changes in the faculty-to-student 
                        ratio during the three school years, let's study the decrease 
                        rates of the students and faculty based on their medians. From 
                        S.Y. 2016-2017 to S.Y. 2017-2018, the decrease rate of the students 
                        was 13.1% while the decrease rate of the faculty was only 3.5%. 
                        This means that the student population in Luzon decreased faster 
                        than the faculty. This calculation is aligned with the increase of 
                        the ratio from 0.67 of S.Y. 2016-2017 to 0.77 of S.Y. 2017-2018, 
                        indicating that more colleges had better ratios in the second year. 
                    </p>

                    <p> <!--fourth paragraph-->
                        However, the median of the ratios decreased in the following 
                        year, from S.Y. 2017-2018’s 0.77 to 0.71 of S.Y. 2018-2019. 
                        This may indicate that there were a few colleges who had a 
                        faculty-student ratio which did not improve or became unfavorable. 
                        This decrease was evident in our data set since students only had a 
                        decrease rate of 0.55% compared to the 3.8% decrease of the faculty 
                        in S.Y. 2017-2018 to S.Y. 2018-2019. At that time, Luzon was losing 
                        more school personnel than students. So, it was reasonable for the 
                        faculty-to-student ratio to deteriorate. Nonetheless, the 
                        general population of the state and private colleges of Luzon had a 
                        relatively satisfactory ratio within the three school years.

                <p> <!--first paragraph-->
                    Compared to other parts of Luzon, the National Capital Region 
                    has the highest education institutions, likely as a result of its 
                    substantial population, advanced infrastructure, and extensive 
                    intellectual resources. The Cordillera Administrative Region, on 
                    the other side, has the fewest colleges. Furthermore, private 
                    universities make up over 95% of all higher education institutions 
                    in Luzon. In general, higher education in Luzon is in good standing 
                    and is progressing positively in terms of the faculty-to-student ratio. 
                    The majority of all the schools in Luzon by S.Y. 2018-2019 already have 
                    a satisfactory faculty-to-student ratio, which often indicates more 
                    individual attention on each student, further promoting their growth 
                    and development. However, colleges in Luzon have faced a decline in the 
                    aspects of student and faculty body for the past three school years. 
                    These declines really show poor development because naturally we should 
                    expect more students at schools due to our increasing population. 
                    Furthermore, if we want to cope with our ideal growing student population, 
                    then more people should be given job opportunities and be employed to cater 
                    to the rising demands of students.
                </p>

                <p> <!--second paragraph-->
                    Considering that CHED (Commission on Higher Education) collects their 
                    data through their “Annual Higher Education Data/Information Collection” 
                    survey, some schools were unable to give their complete data regarding 
                    their student and faculty population. For instance, in the S.Y. 2017-2018, 
                    out of 1098 of S.Y. 2017-2018 colleges, only 624 colleges were able to 
                    provide a complete data of their student population. Moreover, only 1076 
                    colleges were able to provide complete data of their faculty population, 
                    and only 1046 colleges were able to provide complete data of their 
                    faculty/student ratio. Although the effect of these nonresponse biases to 
                    our data sets are mild to none, we cannot counter the fact that these 
                    missing links may serve to benefit to the parameters we are examining.

                <p> <!--third paragraph-->
                    As long as our nation continue to develop and advance its assets, 
                    our education system, especially in higher levels, should always be 
                    given great consideration and attention for our schools are the place 
                    where our students learn how to further develop their skills, become 
                    individuals they aspire to be, and become citizens of our country 
                    who selflessly devote one’s capabilities in service to our nation. 
                    Constant and consistent monitoring of the current state and condition 
                    of our country’s current metropolitan center, which is Luzon, can 
                    greatly aid our government in making informed decisions that would 
                    hopefully improve our education system. With these parameters, it 
                    can also serve as a basis or prompts for future research—finding out 
                    more plausible causes for the decrease of the number of students and 
                    faculty within these three school years. Furthermore, there are many 
                    factors other than location and class size to consider when we examine 
                    higher education. Influences such as economic, cultural, and social factors 
                    and teaching methods are highly encouraged to be studied in future research.
